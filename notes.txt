# 1. read from,to,cc into arrays
    # 2. figure out how to query the prnodes table  
    # this takes a hash of options, almost all of which map directly
    # to the familiar database.yml in rails
    # See http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/MysqlAdapter.html
    # client = Mysql2::Client.new(:host => "localhost", :username => "root", :database => "anotassist_dev")
    # client = Client.find(2)

    # results = client.query("SELECT * FROM prnodes as p WHERE p.pgnodename='"+fromArray+"'") do |row|
    #   puts "Our Query Results"
    #   puts row
    # end 
     

    # Read the To and From address into a local vairable and compare with db values
    # color accordingly
